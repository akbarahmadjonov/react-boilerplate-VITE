# React Boilerplate Template with Vite.js and SCSS

This is a starter template for building modern React applications using Vite.js as the build tool and SCSS for styling. It provides a solid foundation for quickly setting up and developing React projects with the latest tools and best practices.

## Features

- **Vite.js**: Fast, modern build tooling with native ES modules support.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SCSS**: A powerful and widely-used CSS preprocessor for styling.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis to maintain code quality.
- **Prettier**: Code formatting to ensure consistent code style.
- **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Instantly see changes in your application without a full reload.
- **Routing**: Basic routing setup using React Router (you can expand upon this as needed).
- **Customizable**: Easily extend and customize the project structure to fit your needs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akbarahmadjonov/react-boilerplate-VITE/
Change into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd react-vite-scss-boilerplate
Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view your application.
Project Structure
The project structure follows a standard React application layout, with some additional configuration files and directories:

src/: Contains your React application source code.
api/: Place your React APIs here.
app/: SCSS and other stylesheets for your application.
pages/: The main application pages.
shared/: Your images or related to those.
widgets/: For example, your re-usable components.
vite.config.js: Vite.js configuration file.
package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock): Dependency management.
Building for Production
To build your application for production, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
# or
yarn build
This will generate an optimized and minified version of your application in the dist/ directory.
